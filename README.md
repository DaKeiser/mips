# mips
Computer Architecture Project
Design a ​ non-pipelined​ MIPS processor which will take as input- the instruction codes for an N factorial program and produces the necessary output. In how many clock cycles does the output of the program appear?

IF - 
input fact.dat, pc
do pc+=4


ID - (decoding an instruction)
split it into parts


ALU -
inputs [31:0]A, [31:0]B, [2:0]aluopcode
output - "ZERO" signal, Result

MEMORY - 


WRITEBACK -

again deailing with memory
